(9) Whoever says he is in the\nlight and hates his brother is still in darkness. (10) Whoever loves\nhis brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for\nstumbling. (11) But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness\nand walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going,\nbecause the darkness has blinded his eyes. (12) I am writing to\nyou, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name's\nsake. (13) I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who\nis from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because","you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, children, because\nyou know the Father. (14) I write to you, fathers, because you know\nhim who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because\nyou are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have\novercome the evil one. (15) Do not love the world or the things in\nthe world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not\nin him. (16) For all that is in the world--the desires of the flesh and\nthe desires of the eyes and pride of life--is not from the Father but\nis from the world. (17) And the world is passing away along with its\ndesires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever."],"start_index":400023002001,"end_index":400023002017,"verse_count":17,"word_count":427},{"reference":"1 John 3:16-22","translation":"ESV","division":"Senior","passage_number":105,"release":"NBBC","cards":["(16) By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we\nought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
