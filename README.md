# Mock Orals Generator
## Description
This program is aimed at helping contestants in the National Bible Bee Competition. In the oral round, participants have to recite 12 randomly selected passages within a span of 8 minutes.
These recitations are scored off their accuracy. I forked this program from an older version and originally added better features, like a timer and user customization, and a smoother user interface.
## Distinctiveness and Complexity
What sets this program apart is not only its styling, but the idea of having a "duos" session. Basically, users can access the same set of passages from different devices if they have the same code.
I implemented this with a simple database server on Firebase, which updates whenever the users decide to generate a new set of cards. Users can also enter a "judge" mode or a "contestant" mode to simulate the actual oral rounds.
## Access
This program can be accessed via the link: https://evebej.github.io/mock-orals/. To try the duos feature, simply navigate to the duos tab.
